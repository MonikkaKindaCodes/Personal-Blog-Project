            <li>
              A dog’s nose print is unique, much like a person’s fingerprint.
            </li>
            <li>
              Seventy percent of people sign their dog’s name on their holiday
              cards.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dogs’ noses can sense heat/thermal radiation, which explains why
              blind or deaf dogs can still hunt.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only one breed that was among the five most popular breeds in
              1934— the Beagle — still remains in the top five today.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dogs curl up in a ball when sleeping to protect their organs—a
              hold over from their days in the wild, when they were vulnerable
              to predator attacks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Human blood pressure goes down when petting a dog. And so does the
              dog’s.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are over 75 million pet dogs in the U.S.—more than in any
              other country.
            </li>
            <li>All puppies are born deaf.</li>
            <li>
              The Norwegien Lundehund is the least popular dog breed and the
              only dog breed created for the job of puffin hunting.
            </li>
            <li>
              When dogs kick backward after they go to the bathroom it’s not to
              cover it up, but to mark their territory, using the scent glands
              in their feet.
